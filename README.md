# UFOs

## Overview
In this project, we use JavaScript to create a table on the page and create a filter. Then, we use HTML to create a page and the display the table along with a paragraph describing the table. We also use a little CSS in order to make the page display the words better against the background.

## Results
When you first see the HTML page, the first thing to show is the header followed by the article. Underneath the article is the data table and filter below. The filters for the search are Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

In order to make a seach, type in at least one filter and hit the enter button. When typing out the city, state, country, or shape, it is best to type it all in lowercase. The image below is of a search of all the sightings in Texas. The second image is the result of looking for all sightings in Round Rock, Texas.

## Summary
The two main problems with this webpage are that the dataset cannot be shared as it is stored locally and if someone else is using the page, there are no clear instructions on how to filter the results. To fix the first part, a database would have to be used in order for others to see the data on other devices. To fix the second part, I would add the filter button back to allow users to easily know how to filter the data they want to see.
